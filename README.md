## About me
Just your average computer user to this point. Mostly Microsoft Office for work and internet browsing at home. Looking forward to learning how all the screen magic happens so I can make some magic myself.

This is my first formal computer class and I intend to make the most of it. I hope to be able to make something new, useful and fun soon.
